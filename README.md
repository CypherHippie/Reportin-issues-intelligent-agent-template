This is just a simple example, the agents can be enhanced to include more checks and troubleshooting steps, and can also be integrated with other libraries and tools for more advanced troubleshooting.

This code defines a simple multi-agent system for automating the task of reporting issues using a machine learning model. The IssueReporter class is responsible for receiving issue reports, analyzing them, and assigning them to the appropriate team or expert. The IssueAssigner class is responsible for receiving assigned issues and assigning them to experts based on their issue type.

The IssueReporter class has a constructor method that loads a machine learning model for issue classification from a pickle file, and an instance variable that stores a log of reported issues. The report_issue method allows users to report an issue by appending it to the log, and then calling the analyze_issues method to check if the number of reported issues is high, if yes the method sends an alert to the team, otherwise it uses the loaded machine learning model to classify the issue and calls the assign_issue method to assign the issue to the appropriate team or expert.

The IssueAssigner class has a constructor method that initializes an empty dictionary for storing issues by type, and a method for receiving and assigning issues by type. The assign_issues method loops through the issue queue and assigns each issue to an expert using the assign_to_expert method.

It is important to note that this code example is not complete and will not run without additional functionality added. The imports for requests library and the function find_expert() are missing, and the URLs for the alert and issue assignment endpoints are not valid. Additionally, it assumes that there is a machine learning model that is trained and pickled, named "issue_classifier.pkl" in the same directory as the script and that there is a team or experts that are able to receive and handle the issues.

Here are some changes that need to be made:

The analyze_issues method is missing the issue_description variable that it needs to use in the predict call and the assign_issue call. This should be passed as a parameter to the method or stored as an instance variable of the IssueReporter class.

The code is missing the import statement for the requests library. This is used to make the HTTP requests to the alert and assigner systems, so it needs to be imported at the top of the file.

 # import json
 # import requests
 # from sklearn.externals import joblib

The send_alert() method is not implemented correctly. It should use the requests.post() method to send an HTTP POST request to the specified URL, but it's missing the import statement for the request module.

The IssueAssigner class is missing the import statement for the requests library.

The assign_to_expert() method is missing the implementation for the find_expert() method. This method should determine which expert to assign the issue to based on the issue type.

The IssueReporter class should have a method to check if the model loaded correctly or not, and handle the case when the model fails to load.

Also, you need to change the joblib.load with the path of the model file, otherwise it will throw an error.

 # self.model = joblib.load("path/to/your/model/issue_classifier.pkl")

With these changes, the code should work correctly.
